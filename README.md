♻️ RePlastix Innovations – Salesforce Inventory Automation

This project demonstrates how RePlastix Innovations leverages Salesforce CRM to automate recycled plastic inventory management using Apex, Triggers, and Flows. The implementation helps prevent stock shortages, streamline restocking, and enhance cross-team communication through email automation.

💡 Use Case

2. The system checks stock availability:
    If stock is enough → deducts quantity.
    If stock is low → automatically creates a Restock Request.

3. A Manager approves the Restock Request.

4.The system:
    Updates stock.
    Sends an email to the warehouse team.
